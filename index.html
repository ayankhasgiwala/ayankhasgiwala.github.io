      in his life, all of which helped him succeed in his role as an advocate
      for Nature. As America’s most famous naturalist and conservationist, Muir
      fought to protect the wild places he loved, places we can still visit
      today. Muir’s writings convinced the U.S. government to protect Yosemite,
